        <h2>What is SEO?
        </h2>
        <p>SEO means Search Engine Optimization and is the process used to optimize a website's technical configuration,
            content relevance and link popularity so its pages can become easily findable, more relevant and popular
            towards user search queries, and as a consequence, search engines rank them better.

            Search engines recommend SEO efforts that benefit both the user search experience and page’s ranking, by
            featuring content that fulfills user search needs. This includes the use of relevant keywords in titles,
            meta descriptions, and headlines (H1), featuring descriptive URLs with keywords rather than strings of
            numbers, and schema markup to specify the page's content meaning, among other SEO best practices.
            Search engines help people find what they’re looking for online. Whether researching a product, looking for
            a restaurant, or booking a vacation, search engines are a common starting point when you need information.
            For business owners, they offer a valuable opportunity to direct relevant traffic to your website.

            Search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of orienting your website to rank higher on a search engine
            results page (SERP) so that you receive more traffic. The aim is typically to rank on the first page of
            Google results for search terms that mean the most to your target audience. So, SEO is as much about
            understanding the wants and needs of your audience as it is about the technical nature of how to configure
            your website.</p>

        <h2>How do search engines work?</h2>
        <p>Search engines provide results for any search query a user enters. To do so, they survey and “understand” the
            vast network of websites that make up the web. They run a sophisticated algorithm that determines what
            results to display for each search query.

        <h3>Why SEO focuses on Google</h3>
        To many people, the term “search engine” is synonymous with Google, which has about 83% of the global search
        engine market. Because Google is the dominant search engine, SEO typically revolves around what works best for
        Google. It’s useful to have a clear understanding of how Google works and why.
        <h3>What Google wants</h3>
        Google is designed to deliver the best search experience to its users, or searchers. That means providing the
        most relevant results, as quickly as possible.

        The 2 core elements of the search experience are the search term (the user input) and the search results (the
        output).

        Let’s say you search “Mailchimp guides and tutorials.” This is a clear, unambiguous search. Google understands
        what you’re asking for, and it delivers a useful page as the top organic result—Mailchimp’s own page.

        From Google’s perspective, this is a very good search result and a positive user experience, because it’s likely
        that the user will click the top result and be happy with the outcome.
        <h3> How Google makes money</h3>

        Google profits from people trusting and valuing its search service. It achieves this by delivering useful search
        results.

        Google also provides businesses with the opportunity to pay for an advertorial placement at the top of search
        result pages. The word “Ad” indicates these listings. Google makes money when searchers click on these
        pay-per-click (PPC) advertisements, which you purchase through Google Ads. You’ll see these ads on more generic
        queries in particular.

        Other than the small label, these search results look almost indistinguishable from other search results. Of
        course, this is intentional, as lots of users click on these results without realizing that they’re ads.

        This is what Google counts on. Advertising revenues accounted for more than 80% of the $279.8 billion that
        Google generated in 2022. So while search functions remain its core product, it depends on its advertising
        business.</p>

        <h2>Blockchain explained
        </h2>
        <p>As described in Blockchain for Dummies, “Blockchain owes its name to the way it stores transaction data—in
            blocks linked together to form a chain. As the number of transactions grows, so does the blockchain. Blocks
            record and confirm the time and sequence of transactions, which are then logged into the blockchain, within
            a discrete network governed by rules agreed to by the network participants.

            “Each block contains a hash (a digital fingerprint or unique identifier), timestamped batches of recent
            valid transactions, and the hash of the previous block. The previous block hash links the blocks together
            and prevents any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.” In theory,
            the method renders the blockchain tamperproof.

            The four key concepts behind blockchain are:

        <h3> Shared ledger</h3>

        A shared ledger is an “append-only” distributed system of record shared across a business
        network. “With a shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the duplication of effort
        that’s typical of traditional business networks.”
        <h3>Permissions</h3>

        Permissions ensure that transactions are secure, authenticated, and verifiable. “With the
        ability to constrain network participation, organizations can more easily comply with data protection
        regulations, such as those stipulated in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)”
        and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
        <h3>Smart contracts</h3>

        A smart contract is “an agreement or set of rules that govern a business transaction; it’s
        stored on the blockchain and is executed automatically as part of a transaction.”

        <h3>Consensus</h3>

        Through consensus, all parties agree to the network-verified transaction. Blockchains have
        various consensus mechanisms, including proof of stake, multisignature, and PBFT (practical Byzantine fault
        tolerance).
        Each blockchain network has various participants who play these roles, among others:

        Blockchain users. Participants (typically business users) with permissions to join the blockchain network
        and conduct transactions with other network participants.
        Regulators. Blockchain users with special permissions to oversee the transactions happening within the
        network.
        Blockchain network operators. Individuals who have special permissions and authority to define, create,
        manage, and monitor the blockchain network.
        Certificate authorities. Individuals who issue and manage the different types of certificates required to
        run a permissioned blockchain.

        </p>

            <h2>Blockchain and Hyperledger</h2>
            <p>Hyperledger is “an umbrella project of open source blockchains and related tools, started in December
                2015 by the Linux Foundation and supported by industry players like IBM, Intel and SAP to support the
                collaborative development of blockchain-based distributed ledgers.”

                Hyperledger participants believe that “only an Open Source, collaborative software development approach
                can ensure the transparency, longevity, interoperability and support required to bring blockchain
                technologies forward to mainstream commercial adoption.”

                The objective of the Hyperledger project “is to advance cross-industry collaboration by developing
                blockchains and distributed ledgers, with a particular focus on improving the performance and
                reliability of these systems (as compared to comparable cryptocurrency designs) so that they are capable
                of supporting global business transactions by major technological, financial and supply chain
                companies.”</p>

            <h2>Blockchain security</h2>
            <p>Blockchain is frequently claimed to be an “unhackable” technology. But 51% attacks allow threat actors to
                “gain control over more than half of a blockchain’s compute power and corrupt the integrity of the
                shared ledger. … While this particular attack is expensive and difficult, the fact that it was effective
                means that security professionals should treat blockchain as a useful technology—not a magical answer to
                all problems.”

                The 51% attack takes advantage of what is known as the 51% problem: “If a single party possesses 51% of
                a mining pool, it is possible to falsify an entry into the blockchain, allowing for double spending, and
                even to fork a new chain to the advantage of the mining pool.”

                The two main types of blockchain, public and private, offer different levels of security. Public
                blockchains “use computers connected to the public internet to validate transactions and bundle them
                into blocks to add to the ledger. … Private blockchains, on the other hand, typically only permit known
                organizations to join.” Because any organization can join public blockchains, they might not be right
                for enterprises concerned about the confidentiality of the information moving through the network.

                Another difference between public and private blockchains regards participant identity. Public
                blockchains “are typically designed around the principle of anonymity. … A private blockchain consists
                of a permissioned network in which consensus can be achieved through a process called ‘selective
                endorsement,’ where known users verify the transactions. The advantage of this for businesses is that
                only participants with the appropriate access and permissions can maintain the transaction ledger. There
                are still a few issues with this method, including threats from insiders, but many of them can be solved
                with a highly secure infrastructure.”

                Blockchain technologies are growing at an unprecedented rate and powering new concepts for everything
                from shared storage to social networks. From a security perspective, we are breaking new ground. As
                developers create blockchain applications, they should give precedent to securing their blockchain
                applications and services. Activities such as performing risk assessments, creating threat models, and
                doing code analysis, such as static code analysis, interactive application security testing, and
                software composition analysis, should all be on a developer’s blockchain application roadmap. Building
                security in from the start is critical to ensuring a successful and secure blockchain application.</p>
